ðŸ“Œ Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning classification models to predict loan approval outcomes based on customer and financial data. It demonstrates the full pipeline of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source: Comp loan.csv

Contains customer and financial details used to determine loan approval.

ðŸ”„ Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Removed irrelevant columns (id, Unnamed: 0)

Handled missing values

Label Encoding & Feature Scaling

Balanced data using SMOTE

Modeling

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC & ROC Curve

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ðŸ“Š Results

Models were compared based on accuracy and ROC-AUC.

Random Forest and SVM showed strong performance on the dataset.
