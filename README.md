# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts loan approval outcomes based on customer and financial information. The notebook demonstrates preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Task
1. *Loan Approval Prediction*  
   - *Type:* Classification  
   - *Models:* Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest  
   - *Goal:* Predict loan approval status using applicant details and financial data.  

## Workflow
- *Data Preprocessing:* Handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, encoding categorical features, scaling, and balancing data using SMOTE.  
- *Modeling:* Training and comparing multiple classifiers.  
- *Evaluation:* Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  

## Tech Stack
- *Language:* Python  
- *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, imbalanced-learn
